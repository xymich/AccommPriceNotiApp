Upon data taken, remove from slice

BedCount: contains "bed"
BathCount: contains "bath"
Price: starts with "€" else contains "€" else "From"
Address: contains "Co." else town name (need a list)
PropertyType: only a couple can do switch case if matches (ie Semi-D, Terrace, Detatched, Apartment, and more) if not then nothing.
Size: contains m² or other measurements
Seller: take it last most likely first entry in array
